All aspects of this lab have been correctly implemented. I also did the blue and orange lines for the 'Going Beyond' section.
I did not discuss this lab with anyone.
I spent around 4 hours doing this lab. Then maybe another to do the Going Beyond bit.

Part 2:
I have implemented all parts of this lab. The only minor issue is that you have to click the first tested marker twice for data to populate the infowindow.
I discussed this assignment with Jeremy Kanovsky.
I spent probably 6 hours working on this lab.
