I believe I have correctly implemented the aspects of this lab.
I was a little unsure of the format you wanted for us to display the messages though.
I did not collaborate or discuss this assignment with anyone.
This assignment took me about an hour.

Part 2:
I have correctly implemented all aspects of this lab although for instruction 3, no data appeared.
I did learn that this was the point though.
I did not work with anyone on this lab.
This assignment took me maybe 3 hours.
It is not possible to request the data from a different origin using XMLHttpRequest because the Same Origin Policy does not allow it. The data is from another domain and cannot be loaded by anything other than it's own domain.
