All aspects of this lab have been correctly implemented. I also did the blue and orange lines for the 'Going Beyond' section.
I did not discuss this lab with anyone.
I spent around 4 hours doing this lab. Then maybe another to do the Going Beyond bit.

Part 2:
I have implemented all parts of this lab. The only minor issue is that you have to click the first tested marker twice for data to populate the infowindow.
I discussed this assignment with Jeremy Kanovsky.
I spent probably 6 hours working on this lab.

Part 3:
I correctly implemented all aspects of this lab. The only issue is that you may need to double click the infowindow in order for it to update with the correct information.
I discussed this lab with Jeremy Kanovsky.
I spent maybe seven hours on this lab.

For the going beyond section, I chose to implement another MBTA api. I made use of the facilities api. In the map code (stations.js), I did an XMLHttpRequest to open the url, parsed the data and counted how many elevators and escalators were in each station. I then displayed this in the window.
