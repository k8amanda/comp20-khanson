This program uses the Google Maps API as well as MBTA schedule and facilities APIs. When opened, a map opens showing the paths of the MBTA Red, Blue, and Orange lines.

Upon clicking the Red Line stations, an info window will appear stating the current schedule of the trains as well as any available facilities at said station.

Additionally, if you choose to share your location, the closest Red Line T station to you will be stated and the distance from it will be calculated.
