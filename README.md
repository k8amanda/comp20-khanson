COMP 20 Summer 2018 Private Repo for Kate Hanson

This repository was for comp20 lab assignments.
My favorite assignment was the mbta lab. I enjoyed getting to create something so visual and useful.
From day 1, I've definitely grown. I learned so much about web design and I would love to continue doing it.
The most important thing I learned was probably being able to access data from online and use it for my own projects. Using XMLHttpRequest, I could open data useful to the mbta system like the schedule and facilities and display that information in my project.
Moving forward, I would like to learn more about making websites more visually appealing.
